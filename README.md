## 10. Connectivity Test 
    - Execute the endPoint : http://localhost:5183/api/resources/list (GET)
      you should see no errors

## [Angular] - Frontend Project - Bookstore
  - Open the command line 
  - Go to frontend/bookstore folder and run the following commands
        npm install
        npm run start

That should give no errors and lauch a server with the UI, which you should be able to access using this url http://localhost:4200/

## [React] - Frontend Project - Bookstore-react
    - Open the command line
    - Go to frontend/bookstore-react folder and run the following commands
        npm install
        npm run build (build project)
        npm run dev (run project)

That should give no errors and lauch a server with the UI, which you should be able to access using this url http://localhost:5173/

## 11. Known Issues / To do

- **Return Functionality**:
  The return functionality is not working properly. The backend returns a successful response upon attempting to return a resource, but the resource is not actually returned.

- **Renting Unavailable Books**:
  The backend does not return an error when a user attempts to rent unavailable resources and incorrectly lists these resources as available for rent.
